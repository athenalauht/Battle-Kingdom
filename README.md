The game has 2 game mode. Player vs NPC or player vs Player.

Description
A 25 x 25 map will be generated. There will be two castles in each of the diagonal corner. Random paths will be created which connects the castle of the first player to that of the second player. Players have to compete with each other to gain full control of the kingdom.

Game Rule
Each player will have 4 chess pieces to deploy. Initially, all pieces will remain inside the playerâ€™s castle. Players will take turns to move the pieces. In each round, player will choose 1 piece and decide the direction (North, East, South, West) and the number of steps (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to move. However, the piece can only walk straight within a turn (i.e. the player can only walk horizontally or vertically)
However, the piece is forced to stop when it encounters a crossroad (i.e. if there is a crossroad 3 steps from the piece in the south direction, the maximum steps that the piece can move along the south direction is 3).
After moving the piece, if there is an enemy piece along a vertical path or a horizonal path, the player can choose whether to attack or not.
